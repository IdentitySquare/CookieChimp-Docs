## Step 4: Block Scripts/Cookies

To ensure compliance with GDPR regulations, it's crucial not only to display a consent banner but also to actively block all non-essential scripts and cookies until the user has given explicit consent.
For comprehensive instructions on how to effectively manage and block scripts and cookies, please refer to our [Scripts Management Section](/block-scripts-cookies/script-attributes).

## Manual Modal Trigger

To allow users to manage their cookie preferences at any time, add a button with the data attribute `data-cc="show-preferencesModal"`:

```html
<button type="button" data-cc="show-preferencesModal">
  Manage cookie preferences
</button>
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the widget doesn't display, ensure there are no conflicts with other scripts or styles on your website.
- Clear your browser cache and cookies, then reload the website.
