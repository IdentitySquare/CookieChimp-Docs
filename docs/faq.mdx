### How do I verify if everything is working correctly?

Go to "Settings" > "Consent Features" and enable Debug Mode.

Now when a page view or consent is recorded, the banner will log the details in the browser console.

To ensure that the cookies are blocked and added when the consent is recorded, you can use the developer console of your browser.
First, load your website after clearing all the current cookies on the browser or checking from a private browser window.
After the site has been loaded, check the "Storage" tab in the browser console if any cookies have been set.

### Why aren't CookieChimp cookies marked as `HttpOnly`?

`HttpOnly` cookies can only be used in server-side communication.
Since the CookieChimp script is client-side code, in order for it to read these cookies, these cookies cannot be marked as `HttpOnly`.


### Do we support cross-domain consent?

No, we do not support cross-domain consent sharing.

Cross Domain Consent is a type of consent where visitorsâ€™ consent preferences are recognised across multiple domains.
To implement this feature, a third-party cookie must be installed and read from all associated domains.
We do not support this feature as many browsers do not allow setting/sharing of third-party cookies.

However, we do support consent sharing across subdomains when the same CookieChimp script is installed in the subdomain.
This is enabled by default.


### How can I obtain the consent ID?

The consent ID is shown in the preferences modal of the banner.

### Can CookieChimp scan for cookies behind a login?

Yes, our scanner can detect and identify cookies behind a login.
This feature is only available on our custom plans. To configure this, please contact support.


### How do I enable Global Privacy Control?

Go to the "Integrations" page and enable the Global Privacy Control integration.
<img src="/images/faq/gpc.png" alt="Enable Global Privacy Control" />

Now if we detect a Global Privacy Control signal from the browser, the opt-out preferences will automatically be set.
