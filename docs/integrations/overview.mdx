## How Integrations Work

CookieChimp integrations work by:

1. **Detecting user consent changes** - When a user updates their consent preferences
2. **Communicating with third-party APIs** - Sending the consent status to integrated services
3. **Ensuring compliance** - Making sure all tracking and data collection respects user choices
4. **Maintaining functionality** - Keeping your website features working while respecting privacy

## Enabling Integrations

To enable any integration:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page in your CookieChimp dashboard
2. Find the integration you want to enable
3. Click the integration card and follow the setup instructions
4. Configure any required settings specific to that integration

<Info>
  Most integrations are enabled with a simple toggle and don't require additional configuration. Some integrations may require API keys or additional setup steps.

## Integration Categories

Our integrations fall into several categories:

- **Consent Signal** - Services that receive and act on user consent preferences
- **Privacy Controls** - Tools that automatically respect browser-level privacy signals
- **Platform APIs** - Direct integrations with e-commerce and CMS platforms
- **Analytics & Tracking** - Services that need consent information for compliant data collection

Each integration is designed to work seamlessly with CookieChimp's consent management system while maintaining the highest standards of privacy compliance.
