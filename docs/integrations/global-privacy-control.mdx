Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a browser signal that allows users to communicate their privacy preferences to websites automatically. When enabled, CookieChimp will detect GPC signals from visitors' browsers and automatically set their opt-out preferences without requiring interaction with the consent banner.

## What is Global Privacy Control?

Global Privacy Control is a technical specification that allows users to signal their preference to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal data. It's similar to the "Do Not Track" signal but with legal backing in certain jurisdictions like California (CCPA/CPRA).

### How GPC Works with CookieChimp

When a visitor's browser sends a GPC signal:
1. **CookieChimp detects the signal** automatically
2. **Opt-out preferences are set** without showing the banner
3. **Tracking is disabled** according to the user's privacy preference
4. **Compliance is maintained** with privacy regulations

## Browser Support

GPC is supported by several browsers and browser extensions:

- **DuckDuckGo Browser**
- **Brave Browser** (with setting enabled)
- **Firefox** (with extensions like Privacy Badger)
- **Chrome/Edge** (with GPC extensions)
- **Safari** (with GPC extensions)

## How to Enable GPC Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Integrations Page">
    Go to the **Integrations** page in your CookieChimp dashboard.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable GPC Integration">
    Find the "Global Privacy Control" integration card and toggle it on.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Integration">
    Test with a browser that sends GPC signals to verify the banner behavior.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Technical Implementation

When GPC integration is enabled, CookieChimp:

```javascript
// Detects GPC signal from the browser
if (navigator.globalPrivacyControl === true) {
  // Automatically sets opt-out preferences
  // Skips banner display
  // Applies privacy-compliant settings
}
```

<Info>
  The GPC signal is checked before the consent banner is displayed. If a GPC signal is detected, the banner will not be shown and opt-out preferences will be automatically applied.
</Info>

## Verification

To verify that GPC integration is working:

1. **Enable Debug Mode** in Settings > Consent Features
2. **Use a GPC-enabled browser** or extension
3. **Visit your website** and check the browser console
4. **Look for GPC detection logs** confirming the signal was received

## Legal Considerations

GPC compliance helps with:

- **CCPA/CPRA compliance** in California
- **GDPR compliance** for data processing preferences
- **Other state privacy laws** that recognize GPC signals
- **Future privacy regulations** that may require GPC support

<Warning>
  While GPC helps with compliance, consult with legal counsel to ensure your implementation meets all applicable privacy law requirements in your jurisdiction.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- **Keep GPC enabled** once activated to maintain consistent user experience
- **Test regularly** with GPC-enabled browsers to ensure proper functionality
- **Monitor logs** to track GPC signal detection and response
- **Update privacy policies** to mention GPC support and how it's handled
