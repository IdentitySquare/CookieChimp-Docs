Microsoft Clarity Consent Mode integration enables CookieChimp to communicate user consent preferences to Microsoft Clarity, ensuring that session recordings and user analytics respect visitor privacy choices. This integration helps maintain compliance while preserving valuable user behavior insights.

## What is Microsoft Clarity?

Microsoft Clarity is a free user behavior analytics tool that provides:

- **Session recordings** of user interactions
- **Heatmaps** showing click and scroll patterns
- **User journey analysis** and funnel tracking
- **Performance insights** for website optimization

## How Consent Mode Works

When integrated with CookieChimp, Microsoft Clarity Consent Mode:

1. **Receives consent status** from CookieChimp in real-time
2. **Adjusts data collection** based on user preferences
3. **Respects privacy choices** for session recordings
4. **Maintains compliance** with privacy regulations
