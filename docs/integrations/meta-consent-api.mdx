The Meta Consent API integration allows CookieChimp to communicate user consent status directly to Meta (Facebook and Instagram) services. This ensures that Meta's advertising and analytics tools respect user privacy preferences and maintain compliance with privacy regulations.

## What is Meta Consent API?

Meta Consent API is a system that allows websites to programmatically communicate user consent preferences to Meta's advertising platform. This enables:

- **Compliant ad tracking** based on user consent
- **Proper data handling** according to privacy choices
- **Optimized ad delivery** while respecting privacy preferences
- **Regulatory compliance** with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws

## How It Works with CookieChimp

When integrated with CookieChimp, the Meta Consent API:

1. **Receives consent updates** when users change their preferences
2. **Communicates with Meta services** about consent status
3. **Adjusts tracking behavior** based on user choices
4. **Maintains compliance** across Meta's advertising ecosystem

## How to Enable Meta Consent API Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to the **Integrations** page in your CookieChimp dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Meta Consent API">
    Locate the "Meta Consent API" integration in the available integrations section.
  </Step>

    - Testing with different consent choices
    - Monitoring debug logs in CookieChimp
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Technical Implementation

The integration automatically handles consent communication:

```javascript
// When user consent changes
window.addEventListener('cc:onUpdate', function(event) {
  // Meta Consent API automatically receives:
  // - Consent status for advertising
  // - Consent status for analytics
  // - User preference updates
  
  // Meta services adjust behavior accordingly
});
```

## Consent Mapping

CookieChimp maps consent categories to Meta services:

| CookieChimp Category | Meta Service | Purpose |
|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| **Analytics** | Facebook Analytics | Website analytics and insights |
| **Advertising** | Facebook Ads | Ad targeting and attribution |
| **Social Media** | Social Plugins | Facebook Like buttons, comments |
| **Personalization** | Custom Audiences | Personalized ad experiences |

## Verification and Testing

### Using Meta Events Manager
1. **Open Events Manager** in your Meta Business account
2. **Check the Test Events** tool
3. **Look for consent parameters** in event data
4. **Verify proper consent signals** are being sent

### Using CookieChimp Debug Mode
1. **Enable Debug Mode** in CookieChimp settings
2. **Change consent preferences** on your website
3. **Monitor browser console** for Meta API calls
4. **Confirm consent updates** are being transmitted

<Info>
  Meta Consent API integration works automatically once enabled. Consent changes are communicated in real-time without requiring additional configuration.

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance
- Consent is properly withdrawn when users opt out
- Data processing stops for non-consenting users
- Legal basis for processing is clearly established

### CCPA Compliance

- Personal information sharing stops when requested
- User rights are respected across Meta services

### Other Regulations
- Adapts to local privacy requirements
- Supports global privacy frameworks
- Maintains consistent privacy practices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Missing consent signals**: Verify Meta Pixel is properly installed
- **Delayed updates**: Check network connectivity and API status
- **Incorrect mapping**: Review consent category configuration

### Debug Steps
1. **Check Meta Business Manager** for recent activity
2. **Review CookieChimp logs** for API communication
3. **Test with different browsers** and consent choices
4. **Verify Meta Pixel implementation** is working correctly

## Best Practices

- **Regular Testing**: Periodically verify consent signals are working
- **Privacy Policy Updates**: Mention Meta Consent API in your privacy documentation
