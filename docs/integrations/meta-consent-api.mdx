The Meta Consent API integration allows CookieChimp to communicate user consent status directly to Meta (Facebook and Instagram) services. This ensures that Meta's advertising and analytics tools respect user privacy preferences and maintain compliance with privacy regulations.

## What is Meta Consent API?

Meta Consent API is a system that allows websites to programmatically communicate user consent preferences to Meta's advertising platform. This enables:

- **Compliant ad tracking** based on user consent
- **Proper data handling** according to privacy choices
- **Optimized ad delivery** while respecting privacy preferences
- **Regulatory compliance** with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws

## How It Works with CookieChimp

When integrated with CookieChimp, the Meta Consent API:

1. **Receives consent updates** when users change their preferences
2. **Communicates with Meta services** about consent status
3. **Adjusts tracking behavior** based on user choices
4. **Maintains compliance** across Meta's advertising ecosystem
