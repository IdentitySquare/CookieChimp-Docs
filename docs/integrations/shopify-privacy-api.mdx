The Shopify Customer Privacy API integration allows CookieChimp to communicate user consent preferences directly with Shopify's privacy framework. This ensures that your Shopify store's tracking, analytics, and marketing features respect customer privacy choices while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.

## What is Shopify Customer Privacy API?

Shopify's Customer Privacy API is a framework that allows apps and themes to:

- **Respect customer consent** for data collection and tracking
- **Manage privacy preferences** across Shopify's ecosystem
- **Integrate with privacy tools** like CookieChimp
- **Maintain compliance** with privacy regulations

## How It Works with CookieChimp

The integration creates a seamless connection between CookieChimp and Shopify:

1. **Consent Collection**: CookieChimp gathers customer consent preferences
2. **API Communication**: Consent status is sent to Shopify's Privacy API
3. **Store-wide Application**: Shopify apps and features respect the consent choices
4. **Real-time Updates**: Changes in consent are immediately reflected in Shopify
