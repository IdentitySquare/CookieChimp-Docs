## Step 1: Sign Up

- **Create an Account**: Sign up at [CookieChimp.com](https://cookiechimp.com/signup).
- **Configure**: Access your dashboard to set up your cookie consent preferences.

## Step 2: Integration

Choose the integration method suitable for your platform:

### HTML

Add your website's CookieChimp JS snippet in the `<head>` tag of your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://cookiechimp.com/widget/abc123.js"></script>
```

<Info>
  You need to replace `abc123` with your website's unique CookieChimp ID.
</Info>

If you are using a Single Page Application (SPA), you need to ensure to reinitialize the CookieChimp widget on page navigation. You can do this by including the CookieChimp script in the following way (example is for Astro JS):

```html
<script is:inline>
  function runCookieChimp() {
    var script = document.createElement("script");
    script.src = "http://localhost:3000/widget/K8ktWD.js";
    script.id = "cookiechimp-js";
    document.head.appendChild(script);
  }

  // for Astro JS.
  // listen for other events for different frameworks.
  document.addEventListener("astro:page-load", runCookieChimp);
</script>
```

### WordPress

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Download and install the [CookieChimp WordPress plugin](https://github.com/IdentitySquare/CookieChimp-WP/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Install the [WP Consent API plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-consent-api/) from the WordPress plugin directory.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Activate both plugins.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Configure CookieChimp in your WordPress dashboard under 'Settings > CookieChimp'.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The WP Consent API plugin is required for compatibility with Google Site Kit and other WordPress plugins that handle user consent.
</Note>

### Shopify

Add the CookieChimp [Shopify app](#) and set it up in your Shopify admin.

## Step 3: Customization and Testing

- [Customize the appearance](#) and settings of the cookie consent widget from your CookieChimp dashboard.
- Test to ensure it functions correctly on your site.
- CookieChimp will automatically start scanning for [cookies on your website](#). You can view these in your CookieChimp dashboard and organize them.

  <Tip>
    If you have [CookieChimp AI copilot](/ai) enabled, CookieChimp will
    automatically fill in the missing information & categorize these cookies for
    you.
  </Tip>

## Step 4: Block Scripts/Cookies

To ensure compliance with GDPR regulations, it's crucial not only to display a consent banner but also to actively block all non-essential scripts and cookies until the user has given explicit consent.
For comprehensive instructions on how to effectively manage and block scripts and cookies, please refer to our [Scripts Management Section](/block-scripts-cookies/script-attributes).

## Step 5: Allow users to update their preferences

### 5a. Privacy Trigger (Floating Privacy Icon)

CookieChimp provides a floating privacy icon (Privacy Trigger) that allows users to manage their cookie preferences at any time.
You can enable this in the banner settings.

Optionally, you can specify location where the Privacy Trigger is added to the DOM by placing a div with the ID `cookiechimp-container` on the page.

```html
<div id="cookiechimp-container"></div>
```

This is useful for single page applications (SPA) where you want the floating icon to be persistent across different pages.
Ensure to add this in a location which does not get replaced when navigating between pages.

If you are using [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/building#persisting-elements-across-page-loads) or [Astro JS with View Transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/), you can add specific attributes to the div to ensure it persists across navigations.

```html
<!-- For Turbo -->
<div id="cookiechimp-container" data-turbo-permanent></div>

<!-- For Astro JS -->
<div id="cookiechimp-container" transition:persist></div>
```

### 5b. Manually Open Preferences Modal

You can open the preferences modal with a custom link or button by adding a button with the data attribute `data-cc="show-preferencesModal"`:

```html
<button type="button" data-cc="show-preferencesModal">
  Manage cookie preferences
</button>
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the widget doesn't display, ensure there are no conflicts with other scripts or styles on your website.
- Clear your browser cache and cookies, then reload the website.
