## Step 4: Block Scripts/Cookies

To ensure compliance with GDPR regulations, it's crucial not only to display a consent banner but also to actively block all non-essential scripts and cookies until the user has given explicit consent.
For comprehensive instructions on how to effectively manage and block scripts and cookies, please refer to our [Scripts Management Section](/block-scripts-cookies/script-attributes).

## Allow users to update their preferences

Once consent options have been set, users need a way update their preferences.

### Privacy Trigger (Floating Privacy Icon)

CookieChimp provides a floating privacy icon (Privacy Trigger) that allows users to manage their cookie preferences at any time.
You can enable this in the banner settings.

Optionally, you can specify location where the Privacy Trigger is added to the DOM by placing a div with the ID `cookiechimp-privacy-trigger` on the page.

```html
<div id="cookiechimp-privacy-trigger"></div>
```

This is useful for single page applications (SPA) where you want the floating icon to be persistent across different pages.
Ensure to add this in a location which does not get replaced when navigating between pages.

If you are using [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/building#persisting-elements-across-page-loads), you can add `data-turbo-permanent` to the div to ensure it persists across navigations.

```html
<div id="cookiechimp-privacy-trigger" data-turbo-permanent></div>
```

### Manually Open Preferences Modal

You can open the preferences modal with a custom link or button by adding a button with the data attribute `data-cc="show-preferencesModal"`:

```html
<button type="button" data-cc="show-preferencesModal">
  Manage cookie preferences
</button>
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the widget doesn't display, ensure there are no conflicts with other scripts or styles on your website.
- Clear your browser cache and cookies, then reload the website.
