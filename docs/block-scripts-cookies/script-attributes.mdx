## Script Attributes and Usage

Control your scripts using these attributes:

- `data-category`: Assigns the script to a consent category. You can find the ID of each category from your CookieChimp dashboard.
- `data-service` (optional): Name of the company, service or a group of scripts. Can be used to disable a single service in a category while leaving others enabled - or the other way around.
- `data-type` (optional): Defines a custom script type.
- `data-src` (optional): Can be used instead of `src` for validation purposes.

## Code Examples

```html
<script>
  // Always executed
</script>

<script type="text/plain" data-category="analytics">
  // Executed when user consents to the "analytics" category
</script>

<script
  type="text/plain"
  data-category="analytics"
  data-service="Hotjar"
>
  // Executed when user consents to "Hotjar" service
</script>

<!-- Script loads when user consents to "Hotjar" service -->
<script
  type="text/plain"
  data-src="https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-XXXXX.js?sv=X"
  data-category="analytics"
  data-service="Hotjar"
></script>
```

<Tip>
  You can also run scripts when a category or service is disabled (if it was
  previously enabled) by prepending the '!' character to the name.

```html
<script type="text/plain" data-category="!analytics">
  // Executed when the "analytics category is disabled
</script>
```
