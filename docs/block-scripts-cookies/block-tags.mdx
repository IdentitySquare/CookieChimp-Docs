## Step 2: Setup Cookie Categories

GTM supports 7 different consent types. CookieChimp maps these Google consent types into the following categories:

| CookieChimp Category ID | Google Consent Type                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| essential               | functionality_storage, security_storage      |
| marketing               | ad_storage, ad_user_data, ad_personalization |
| analytics               | analytics_storage                            |
| personalization         | personalization_storage                      |

These categories are setup by default.
When a user opts-in to a conset category, the linked Google consent type will change from 'denied' to 'granted' and vice versa.

## Step 3: Set up Google Tag

- **Sign in to your Google Tag Manager account and add a new tag.**

- **Choose the type of tag you want to create.**

- **Add any additional consent checks for the tag to fire.**

  Navigate to "Advanced Settings" > "Consent Settings". Check the "Require additional consent for tag to fire" button and add any additional consent checks from the dropdown of options.

- **Add a custom trigger.**

  This is required to listen for changes in consent state. This event will be triggered by CookieChimp on page load and when the user changes their consent settings.

  Choose "Custom Event"

  <img

    alt="Choose Custom Event"
  />

  Set up the custom trigger with event name `cookie_consent_update` and save the tag.

    alt="Create custom trigger"
  />

This tag is now set up and will only fire when the required consent is granted.
