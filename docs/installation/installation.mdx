<Steps>
  <Step title="Add our JS code">
    Add your website's CookieChimp JS snippet in the `<head>` tag of your HTML:

    <Info>
      The CookieChimp script needs to be added at the top of the `<head>` section, so that it can run first, in order to ensure other scripts are only run based on consent.
      If other scripts are added before, they may set cookies and other storage items before consent is granted.
    </Info>

    ```html
    <script src="https://cookiechimp.com/widget/abc123.js"></script>
    ```

    You need to replace `abc123` with your website's unique CookieChimp ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Block Scripts & Cookies">
    To ensure compliance with GDPR regulations, it's crucial not only to display a consent banner but also to actively block all non-essential scripts and cookies until the user has given explicit consent.
    For comprehensive instructions on how to effectively manage and block scripts and cookies, please refer to our [Scripts Management Section](/block-scripts-cookies/script-attributes).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Allow users to update their preferences">
    CookieChimp provides a floating privacy icon (Privacy Trigger) that allows users to manage their cookie preferences at any time.
    You can enable this in the banner settings.

    Optionally, you can open the preferences modal with a custom link or button by adding a button with the data attribute `data-cc="show-preferencesModal"`:

    ```html
    <button type="button" data-cc="show-preferencesModal">
      Manage cookie preferences
    </button>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- Check if the domain is allowed in the Settings page on our platform.
- If the widget doesn't display, ensure there are no conflicts with other scripts or styles on your website.
- Clear your browser cache and cookies, then reload the website.
- Enable "Debug mode" from our platform and open JS console to check for any errors.
