  <Step title="Install WP Consent API plugin">

    This allows other Wordpress plugins that support WP Consent API to run tags based on user's consent.

CookieChimp will now inform the WP Consent API plugin the user's consent state.
This API is listened to by other WP plugins such as Google Site Kit to enable/disable their scripts.
