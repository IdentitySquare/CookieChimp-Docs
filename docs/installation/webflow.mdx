<Steps>
  <Step title="Add CookieChimp Script to Site Settings">
    In your Webflow dashboard, navigate to your project settings:

    1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Custom Code**
    <img src="/images/webflow/webflow-project-settings.png" alt="Webflow Project Settings navigation" />
    
    2. In the **Head Code** section, add your CookieChimp script:
    <img src="/images/webflow/webflow-custom-code-head.png" alt="Webflow Custom Code Head section" />

    <Info>
      The CookieChimp script needs to be added in the Head Code section so that it loads first, before other scripts. This ensures other scripts only run based on user consent.
    </Info>

    ```html
    <script src="https://cookiechimp.com/widget/abc123.js"></script>
    ```

    Replace `abc123` with your unique CookieChimp Account ID from your [CookieChimp dashboard](https://cookiechimp.com/dashboard).

    3. Click **Save Changes**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Privacy Trigger Container (Optional)">
    If you want to customize where the privacy trigger (floating icon) appears, you can add a specific container element:

    1. In the **Webflow Designer**, add a **Div Block** where you want the privacy trigger to appear
    2. Set the Div Block's **ID** to `cookiechimp-container` in the Element Settings panel
    <img src="/images/webflow/webflow-element-id-setting.png" alt="Setting element ID in Webflow Designer" />
    3. This div will host the floating privacy icon, allowing users to update their preferences

    <Note>
      If you don't add this container, CookieChimp will automatically place the privacy trigger in an appropriate location.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Custom Consent Button (Optional)">
    You can add custom buttons or links to open the consent preferences modal:

    1. Select any **Button** or **Link** element in the Designer
    2. In the Element Settings panel, add a **Custom Attribute**:
       - **Name**: `data-cc`
       - **Value**: `show-preferencesModal`
    <img src="/images/webflow/webflow-custom-attribute.png" alt="Adding custom attributes in Webflow" />

    This allows users to manage their cookie preferences through your custom UI elements.

    ```html
    <!-- Example of what gets generated -->
    <button data-cc="show-preferencesModal">
      Manage Cookie Preferences
    </button>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Your Site">
    1. Click **Publish** in the top-right corner of the Designer
    2. Select your domain and publish the changes
    3. The CookieChimp consent banner will now appear on your live site

    <Info>
      Make sure your domain is added to the **Additional Domains** section in your CookieChimp Account Settings > General if you're using a custom domain.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webflow-Specific Considerations

### Custom Code Limitations
- Webflow's custom code is applied site-wide. If you need page-specific consent handling, consider using Webflow's conditional visibility features
- Custom code in Webflow is processed during site publishing, so changes require republishing your site

### E-commerce Integration
For Webflow E-commerce sites:
- CookieChimp will automatically handle e-commerce tracking scripts based on user consent
- Ensure your analytics and marketing pixels are properly categorized in your CookieChimp dashboard
- Consider enabling the **E-commerce** category in your banner settings for commerce-specific cookies

### CMS Collections
If you're using Webflow CMS:
- The CookieChimp script will work across all CMS template pages
- Dynamic content loading will respect user consent preferences
- No additional configuration needed for CMS-generated pages

## Troubleshooting

**Banner not showing:**
- Verify your Account ID is correct in the script tag
- Check that your domain is allowed in CookieChimp Account Settings
- Ensure the script is in the **Head Code** section, not Footer Code

**Script conflicts:**
- If you have other analytics or tracking scripts in custom code, ensure CookieChimp loads first
- Move other tracking scripts to the **Footer Code** section or use CookieChimp's script management features

**Custom styling issues:**
- Use CookieChimp's Banner Designer for visual customization
- For advanced CSS customization, add custom styles to your Webflow project's custom CSS
