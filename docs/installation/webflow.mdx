  <Step title="Add CookieChimp Script to Site Settings">
    In your Webflow dashboard, navigate to your project settings:

    1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Custom Code**
    2. In the **Head Code** section, add your CookieChimp script:

    <Info>
      The CookieChimp script needs to be added in the Head Code section so that it loads first, before other scripts. This ensures other scripts only run based on user consent.
    </Info>

    ```html
    <script src="https://cookiechimp.com/widget/abc123.js"></script>
    ```

    Replace `abc123` with your unique CookieChimp Account ID from your [CookieChimp dashboard](https://cookiechimp.com/dashboard).

    3. Click **Save Changes**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Allow users to update their preferences">
    CookieChimp provides a floating privacy icon that allows users to manage their cookie preferences at any time. Alternatively, you can add a custom button or link in your website's footer to allow users to update their preferences:

    1. Select any **Button** or **Link** element in the Designer
    2. In the Element Settings panel, add a **Custom Attribute**:
       - **Name**: `data-cc`
       - **Value**: `show-preferencesModal`

    ```html
    <!-- Example of what gets generated -->
    <button data-cc="show-preferencesModal">
      Manage Cookie Preferences
    </button>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Your Site">
    1. Click **Publish** in the top-right corner of the Designer
    2. Select your domain and publish the changes
    3. The CookieChimp consent banner will now appear on your live site

    <Info>
      Make sure your domain is added to the **Additional Domains** section in your CookieChimp Account Settings > General if you're using a custom domain.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

**Banner not showing:**
- Verify your Account ID is correct in the script tag
- Check that your domain is allowed in CookieChimp Account Settings
- Ensure the script is in the **Head Code** section, not Footer Code

**Script conflicts:**
- If you have other analytics or tracking scripts in custom code, ensure CookieChimp loads first
- Move other tracking scripts to the **Footer Code** section or use CookieChimp's script management features

**Custom styling issues:**
- Use CookieChimp's Banner Designer for visual customization
- For advanced CSS customization, add custom styles to your Webflow project's custom CSS
