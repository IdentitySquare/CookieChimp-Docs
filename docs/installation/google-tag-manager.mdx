Add your website's CookieChimp JS snippet in the `<head>` tag of your HTML. 

<Warning>Do not add our HTML code via Google Tag Manager since we set the default consent states before Google Tag Manager runs.</Warning>

<Info>
  The CookieChimp script needs to be added at the top of the `<head>` section, so that it can run first, in order to ensure other scripts are only run based on consent.
  If other scripts are added before, they may set cookies and other storage items before consent is granted.
</Info>

```html
<script src="https://cookiechimp.com/widget/abc123.js"></script>
```

You need to replace `abc123` with your website's unique CookieChimp ID.


# Block Tags with Google Tag Manager

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Google Consent Mode">

    Navigate to "Integrations" from the sidebar and enable the Google Consent Mode integration.

    <img src="/images/google-tag-manager/enable-gcm.png" alt="Enable GCM" />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add/Edit Tag">

    Create or update a tag and add any additional consent checks for the tag to fire.

      Navigate to "Advanced Settings" > "Consent Settings". Check the "Require additional consent for tag to fire" button and add any additional consent checks from the dropdown of options.
      This can be a service name as added on the platform.

      <img
        src="/images/google-tag-manager/consent-settings.png"
        alt="Consent Settings"
      />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a custom trigger">
    This is required to listen for changes in consent state. This event will be triggered by CookieChimp on page load and when the user changes their consent settings.

    <img src="/images/google-tag-manager/add-trigger.png" alt="Add Trigger" />

    Choose "Custom Event"

    <img
      src="/images/google-tag-manager/choose-trigger.png"
      alt="Choose Custom Event"
    />

    Set up the custom trigger with event name `cookiechimp_consent_update` and save the tag.

    <img
      src="/images/google-tag-manager/create-custom-trigger.png"
      alt="Create custom trigger"
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

This tag is now set up and will only fire when the required consent is granted.

## Category Mapping

  GTM supports 7 different default consent types. CookieChimp maps these Google consent types into the following categories:

  | CookieChimp Category ID | Google Consent Type                          |
  | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
  | essential               | functionality_storage, security_storage      |
  | marketing               | ad_storage, ad_user_data, ad_personalization |
  | analytics               | analytics_storage                            |
  | personalization         | personalization_storage                      |

  These categories are setup by default. When a user opts-in to a consent category or a Google service in the category is consented to, the linked Google consent type will change from 'denied' to 'granted' and vice versa.

  Apart from the default 7 consent types, we will also send the consent state of your services to Google. e.g. When a user consents to a service named "Hotjar", the consent for this service is updated as 'granted'.
