title: "Wildcard Cookies"
description: "Group similar cookies, reducing the need to categorize each one individually."

Platforms that generate unique cookie names for each session or user can create an overwhelming number of individual cookies. Wildcards streamline this by grouping these cookies under a single pattern.

Use `*` in cookie names to match any cookie that follows a certain pattern.

## Usage

- Standard Naming: `session_12345`, `session_67890`, etc.
- Wildcard Usage: `session_*`

This wildcard pattern will match any cookie that starts with `session_`, treating them as a single group.
