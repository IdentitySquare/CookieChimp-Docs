Platforms that generate unique storage item names, for each session or user, can create an overwhelming number of individual cookies. Wildcards streamline this by grouping these under a single pattern.

Use `*` in storage item names to match any storage item that follows a certain pattern.

## Usage

- Standard Naming: `session_12345`, `session_67890`, etc.
- Wildcard Usage: `session_*`

This wildcard pattern will match any storage item of the same type that starts with `session_`, treating them as a single group.
