## Cookie Categories

Cookie Categories are used to organize your cookies into groups. You can create as many categories as you need. The default categories are:

- Essential
- Analytics
- Marketing
- Personalization

Users will be consenting to these groups of cookies. Each group will have a toggle switch to allow users to opt-in or opt-out of the category.

## Services

Services are used to group cookies associated to a company or service.
Cookies can be directly added to a cookie category or you can group them into services. Services must be associated with a cookie category and each service will have a toggle inside its category section to allow users to opt-in or opt-out of the service. You can then use the services attribute to [block scripts](/docs/block-scripts-cookies).
