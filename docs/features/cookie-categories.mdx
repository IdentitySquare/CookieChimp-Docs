## Cookie Categories

Cookie Categories are used to organize your cookies into groups. You can create as many categories as you need. The default categories are:

- Essential
- Analytics
- Marketing

Users will be consenting to these groups of cookies. Each group will have a toggle switch to allow users to opt-in or opt-out of the category.

## Cookie Details

Cookie Details are used to describe the cookies used on your website. The required fields are the cookie name and category. The other fields are optional but recommended. You can use CookieChimp's [AI Auto-fill](/docs/ai) feature to automatically fill in the cookie details.
