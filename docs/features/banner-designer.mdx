## Geo Targeting

Banners can be set up to show worldwide or only in certain countries or US states.

Multiple banners can be set up in this way to match the user's country and their regulations.

## Force Consent

The force consent option can be toggled to increase consent rates.

When this option is enabled, the user is forced to accept/deny consent before interacting with the website.

- Colors - Customize the banner's primary colors, text colors, and button colors to match your brand
- Border radius - Adjust the roundness of corners on the banner, buttons and modal

These theme settings apply to both the consent banner and preferences modal to maintain a consistent look across all consent UI elements.
