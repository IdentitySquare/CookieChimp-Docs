## Geo Targeting

Banners can be configured to show only in specific countries or U.S. states. This lets you create multiple banners customised for different regions and their regulations.

## Force Consent

The force consent option can be toggled to increase consent rates.

When this option is enabled, the user is forced to accept/deny consent before interacting with the website.

## Layouts

The layout, position and button placement of banners can be customised to fit your website's style.

Similarly, the layout of the preferences modal can also be customised.

## Banner Buttons

The weights, position and text of banner buttons can be customised.

<Note>
  Some regulations like GDPR require banner buttons to be equally weighted.
  Some regulations might require specific text for buttons.
</Note>

## Privacy Trigger

The privacy trigger is a floating button that allows users to update their consent preferences at any time.
This can be enabled/disabled and its position can be customised.

<Note>
  Most regulations mandate that users must be able to update their consent preferences after giving their initial consent.
  You can enable this using our Privacy Trigger or by [adding your own button or link](/docs/advanced/callbacks-events#showpreferences) to open the preferences.
</Note>

## Preferences Control Level

The preferences modal can be customised to only show categories or to show their services and cookies and allow users to have more granular control.

<Note>
Some regulations require all storage items and services to be shown.
</Note>

## Theme

The banner's appearance can be customised with various theme options:

- Dark/Light mode - Choose between light, dark, or auto mode that follows the user's system preferences
- Colors - Customise the banner's primary colors, text colors, and button colors to match your brand
- Border radius - Adjust the roundness of corners on the banner, buttons and modal
- Logo - Add your company logo to reinforce brand identity

These theme settings apply to both the consent banner and preferences modal to maintain a consistent look across all consent UI elements.
