We scan your website to find the vendors and storage items used on your site.
We check what storage items were set before and after consent was granted.

If a service runs, that are not supposed to run before consent is granted, we will flag this as `Ran before consent`.

If we detect storage items from a service that is not shown in your banner, we will flag the service as `Not shown in banner`.

If we detect storage items that are not in your banner and we cannot match to a vendor/service, we will flag these as `Not part of a category or service`.

If everything is set up correctly then we flag the service as `All good`.

We also check if users can update their consent with our privacy trigger button.

## Manual Scanning

Scans can be created from the Website Scan page.
