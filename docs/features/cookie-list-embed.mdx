## iFrame

Embed your CookieChimp cookie categories & cookies on your website.
This is useful for embedding your cookie list on your cookie policy or privacy policy page.

Copy and paste the following code into your website:

```html
<div id="cookiechimp-cookie-list" data-dark-mode="auto"></div>
```

Possible values for `data-dark-mode` are `auto`, `true` and `false`. This will override the dark mode setting in your CookieChimp account.

You can configure other settings in your CookieChimp account to match your website's design.

<Note>CookieChimp JS must be loaded for the cookie list to render.</Note>

## Direct Link

You can also link directly to your cookie list by directing your users to the following URL:

```
https://cookiechimp.com/privacy-portal/abc123
```

Replace `abc123` with your CookieChimp account ID. You can find your account ID in your CookieChimp account settings.
