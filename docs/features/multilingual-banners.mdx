## Language Detection

We can detect language based on:
1. The HTML document language - controlled by the [lang attribute](https://www.tpgi.com/using-the-html-lang-attribute/) in the `html` element.
2. The user's browser language - set by the user's browser.

The default language is used if the visitor's language is not supported or there is no translation available for the visitor's language.

## Translations

Consent banners can be translated into multiple languages.

We offer AI auto translate for paid accounts to quickly translate into another language.

<Note>
  Always check and verify AI translations before saving.

Similarly categories, services and storage items can be individually translated.
