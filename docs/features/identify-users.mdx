Identify consent records stored on CookieChimp with your application's user IDs. This allows you to search for consent records and cookies set on each session.

Add the following code to your HTML page, replacing `your_user_ID_123` with your user's ID. Add this as high up in the `<head>` as possible. This code needs to have executed before CookieChimp loads.

```html
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  window.dataLayer.push({
    userId: "your_user_ID_123", // Replace with your generated ID
  });
</script>
```

<Note>
  **Don't use any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) as the user ID.** It's
  best to use a unique ID that you can match with your database. If you use an
  email address, IP address or any other personal information, CookieChimp will
  discard this information and no user ID will be set.
