## Categories

Categories are used to organize vendors into groups.
You can create as many categories as you need and edit the default ones.

The default categories are:
- Essential
- Analytics
- Marketing
- Personalization

A category becomes active when it contains an active service or storage items. Only active categories are shown to visitors in the banner.

## Vendors

Storage items set by a vendor/service can be grouped together.
Services must be associated with a category and each service will have a toggle inside its category section to allow users to opt-in or opt-out of the service.
You can then use the services attribute to [block scripts until consent](/docs/block-scripts-cookies).

CookieChimp offers a vendor library of popular services that contain storage items set by the service.
Simply select the ones used in your site and add.

If you are using a service that is not in our vendor library, you can create a service manually.

## Storage Items

Storage items can be of three types:
 - Cookie
 - Local Storage
 - Session Storage

Storage items can be grouped together into a service or be added to a category directly.
